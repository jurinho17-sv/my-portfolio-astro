# [CS 61A] Week 1

Hi, I'm Ju Ho Kim and thank you very much for taking your time to visit my website!

From now on, I'll try to upload my study logs like this whenever I can. I'll be writing these with my random thoughts.

It's already the third week of the class, but I've been swamped since it's the beginning of the semester and I know it's a shit of an excuse. Anyways, that's why I'm uploading this now.

![Yes I'm cooked.](./_images/02-cs61a-week1-2/iamcooked.png)

For week 1, there were no heavy things yet, but like my professor said,

> "All complex things always begin with fundamentals"

Let's go.

---

## A. Functions

> "Fundamentally, the qualities of good functions all reinforce the idea that **functions are abstractions.**"

This was the first main topic covered in this class.

- **Data** is stuff that we want to manipulate
- **Functions** describe the rules for manipulating the data

<br />

### 1. Non-Pure Print Function

```python
>>> print(print(1), print(2))
1
2
None None
```

#### **print** vs **return**
- The value that `print()` returns is always `None`
- `print()` does not return a useful result
- `print()` is only used so that we can see the intermediate results

```python
def letssee():
    print('You will see this')
    return 'Exiting this function.'    # function call termination
    print('but not this one')

>>> letssee()
You will see this
'Exiting this function.'
```
- when python executes a `return` statement, the function call **terminates** immediately
- `print()` will display text **without the quotes**
- but, `return` will **preserve the quotes**

<br />

### 2. Defining New Functions

```python
def <name>(<formal parameters>):
    return <return expression>
```

<br />

### 3. Calling a User-Defined Functions

**Global** vs. **Local** frame >> must be on the midterm (related to *Environement Diagram*)

An example from our [textbook](https://www.composingprograms.com/pages/13-defining-new-functions.html)

![sum_squares() is bound to a user-defined function in the global frame](./_images/02-cs61a-week1-2/0.png)

![Then the function introduces a local frame that binds x to 5 and y to 12 in the local frame](./_images/02-cs61a-week1-2/1.png)

![square() names a user-defined function in the global frame, while x names the number 5 in the local frame. Python applies square to 5 by introducing yet another local frame that binds x to 5.](./_images/02-cs61a-week1-2/2.png)

![mul(x, x) evaluates to 25](./_images/02-cs61a-week1-2/3.png)

![Python evaluates the body of square() again, this time introducing yet another local frame that binds x to 12](./_images/02-cs61a-week1-2/4.png)

![As like above, square(y) evaluates to 144](./_images/02-cs61a-week1-2/5.png)

![25 and 144 yield a return value for sum_squares(), which is 169](./_images/02-cs61a-week1-2/6.png)

![ended](./_images/02-cs61a-week1-2/7.png)

#### Function Objects vs Function Calls

```python
operation = add     # stores function object
operation(2, 3)     # it works (function object is callable)
```

However,

```python
result = add(2, 3)  # stores function call result 5
result(2, 3)        # ERROR (integer is not callable)
```

You might be thinking who the hell doesn't know this. That's me. I lost points on this today.

So please, on the exam, distinguish whether I need **a function object** or **a function call result**

It was way more important than I thought.
<br />

### 4. Functional Abstraction

Three core attributes of a *functional abstraction*:

- The **domain** of a function is the set of arguments it can take
- The **range** of a function is the set of values it can return
- The **intent** of a function is the relationship it computes between inputs and output (as well as any side effects it might generate)

<br />

### 5. Operators

```python
>>> 5 / 4
1.25

>>> 5 / 0
ZeroDivisionError
```
`/` results in a *floating point* (decimal division)

On the other hand,

```python
>>> 5 // 4
1

>>> 5 // 0
ZeroDivisionError
```
`//` rounds the result *down* to an integer (integer division)

Also,

```python
# modulus operator â‡” remainder operator

>>> 5 % 4
1

>>> 7 % 3
1

>>> 5 % 0
ZeroDivisionError
```
`%` yields the *remainder* (remainder)

<br />
<br />

---

## B. Control

> "Control statements are statements that control the flow of a program's execution based on the results of logical comparisons."

In other words, **Control** structures make programs smart by
- make decisions (`if` / `else`)
- repeat actions (`while` loops)
- test themselves (assertions)

<br />

### 1. Statements VS Expressions

| Expressions | Statements |
|:---:|:---:|
| calculate values | do actions |
| `2 + 3` gives `5` | `x = 5` stores value |

#### please don't do this
```python
def square(x):
    mul(x, x)           # not recommended, cuz it's useless
                        # calculates but returns nothing
                        # it throws away the result
```
#### instead, do this
```python
def square(x):
    return mul(x, x)    # returns the result
```
<br />

### 2. Compound Statements

```python
# clause = header + suite
header:         # header (ends with ':')
    statement   # suite (indented)
    statement   # suite (indented)
    ...
```
- simple statements: `x = 5`, `return x`
- compound statements: `def`, `if`, `while`

<br />

### 3. Local Assignment

Each function has their **own** workspace in which variables inside don't affect outside of the function

```python
def percent_difference(x, y):
    difference = abs(x-y)    # Local variable
    return 100 * difference / x

# the variable 'difference' only exists inside the function
```

#### Rules for Local Assignment (midterm - environment diagram)

- each function call (not `def` statement) creates **a new local frame**
- assignment statements **bind** names in the local frame only
- cannot affect the global frame

#### benefits
- **Modular**: make programs manageable
- **Safety**: no changes to global variables
- **Clarity**: you know it

<br />

### 4. Conditional Statements

```python
if <expression1>:
    <suite> # do this
elif <expression2>:
    <suite> # do that
else:
    <suite> # otherwise
```

#### sequence of `if`/`else` statement
1. evaluate each condition in order
2. execute suite of first true condition
3. skip all remaining clauses
4. if all conditions false, execute `else` suite (if present)

#### Boolean values
- **False** values: `0`, `None`, `False`, `""`, `[]`
- **True** values: otherwise (including negative numbers)

#### Comparison Operators
```python
4 < 2        # False
5 >= 5       # True
0 == -0      # True (equality comparison)
x = 5        # not comparision, it's "assignment" (different from ==)
```

#### Logical(Boolean) Operators
```python
True and False   # False
True or False    # True
not False        # True
```

#### Logical Operators with **Short-circuiting**
```python
False and expensive_function()  # expensive_function() never called
True or expensive_function()    # expensive_function() never called
```

<br />

### 5. Iteration (`while` loops)

Computers are way better at iterations. We should take advantage of that.

```python
while <expression>:
    <suite>
```

#### sequence of `while` loop

1. evaluate header expression
2. if true, execute entire suite, then return to step 1
3. suite **must** change some binding to prevent infinite loops

#### Fibonacci 

Fibonacci example from [the textbook](https://www.composingprograms.com/pages/15-control.html)

```python
def fib(n):
    """Compute the nth Fibonacci number, for n >= 2."""
    pred, curr = 0, 1   # start with 0, 1
    k = 2               # counter
    while k < n:
        pred, curr = curr, pred + curr  # next number (simultaneous assignment)
        k = k + 1       # update counter
    return curr

result = fib(8)
```

##### Simultaneous Assignment

Look at the sixth line from the Fibonacci example
```python
pred, curr = curr, pred + curr
```

- All expressions on **right** are evaluated first
- Then all bindings on left are updated **simultaneously**

#### Avoid Infinite loops

Infinite loops occur when the suite *never changes* its condition

```python
# bad one
while True:
    print("Forever...")     # I AM COOKED

# good one
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1              # changes the condition
```
<br />

### 6. Testing

to make sure all the functions work as intended

#### Assert Statements

```python
assert fib(8) == 13, 'The 8th Fibonacci number should be 13'
```

- if true: nothing happens
- if false: an ERROR message pops up

#### Test Functions

```python
def fib_test():
    assert fib(2) == 1, 'The 2nd Fibonacci number should be 1'  # '', "" doesn't matter
    assert fib(3) == 1, 'The 3rd Fibonacci number should be 1' 
    assert fib(50) == 7778742049, 'Error at the 50th Fibonacci number'
```

#### Doctests

Another snippet from [the textbook](https://www.composingprograms.com/pages/15-control.html)

```python
# in documentation
def sum_naturals(n):
    """Return the sum of the first n natural numbers.

    >>> sum_naturals(10)
    55
    >>> sum_naturals(100)
    5050
    """
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + k, k + 1
    return total
```

```python
# running Doctests
from doctest import run_docstring_examples
run_docstring_examples(sum_naturals, globals(), True)

# Or from command line:
# python3 -m doctest <python_source_file>
```

**Unit Testing:** testing *individual functions* in isolation

#### Edge Case handling
- special cases like `n = 1`
- handling first and last value output

<br />

### 7. cf.

| Concepts | Syntax | Purpose |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| if | `if <condition>:` | make dicisions |
| while | `while <condition>:` | repeat actions |
| assert | `assert condition, "message"` | test functions |
| **local** vars | `variable = value` (inside function) | store temporary values in **local frame** |
