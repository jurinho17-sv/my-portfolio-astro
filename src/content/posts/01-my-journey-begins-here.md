# My Journey Begins Here

Hi, my name is Ju Ho Kim and thank you very much for taking your time to visit my website!

I'm very new to writing and managing blog stuff, but I am writing to record my journey and I think I might want to look back to see how far I've come maybe at some point in the future. So I thought writing blogs would be meaningful and worth it!

## From Seoul to San Francisco

*It wasn't even the lawn areas of the campus, but still there were a few deer. That's crazy. I love it here already.*

*On the first day of school, after having lunch, I just wanted to walk towards the hill located near Soda Hall. I walked up for like 15 minutes, and then I turned around and was able to see this view.*

Moving here, unpacking stuff, going to orientation. What a crazy busy week it's been.

I came here to go Silicon Valley someday.

I don't even know what I'm going to do in the future.

But, I feel it. 

The Bay Area was the place I've always wanted to be.

And I'm here right now.

Let's get started.

*The view from the balcony at the top of my dorm at sunset. I can see the city of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge. I hope my future is there.*
