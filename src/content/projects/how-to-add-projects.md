# How to Add New Projects

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of adding new projects to your portfolio website, from creating the project file to publishing it online.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Markdown syntax
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Git installed on your computer
- Access to your portfolio repository

## Step 1: Create a New Project File

### File Location
All projects are stored in the `/src/content/projects/` directory.

### File Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- Make it descriptive and unique
- Always use `.md` extension

**Examples:**
- `weather-app.md`
- `e-commerce-website.md`
- `machine-learning-classifier.md`

### Creating the File
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/portfolio

# Create a new project file
touch src/content/projects/your-project-name.md
```

## Step 2: Set Up the Project Frontmatter

Every project must start with frontmatter (metadata) enclosed in `---`:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Project Title"
description: "A brief, compelling description of your project"
startDate: 2025-01-15
endDate: 2025-02-01          # Optional: leave out if ongoing
technologies: ["React", "Node.js", "MongoDB"]
githubUrl: "https://github.com/username/repo"
liveUrl: "https://your-project.vercel.app"
featured: true               # Set to true for homepage showcase
draft: false                 # Set to true to hide from public
---
```

### Frontmatter Fields Explained

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `title` | ✅ | String | The name of your project |
| `description` | ✅ | String | Brief description for project cards |
| `startDate` | ✅ | Date | When you started the project (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `endDate` | ❌ | Date | When you completed it (omit if ongoing) |
| `technologies` | ❌ | Array | Tech stack used in the project |
| `githubUrl` | ❌ | String | Link to GitHub repository |
| `liveUrl` | ❌ | String | Link to live demo/deployment |
| `featured` | ❌ | Boolean | Show in featured projects section |
| `draft` | ❌ | Boolean | Hide from public if true |

## Step 3: Write Your Project Content

After the frontmatter, describe your project in detail using Markdown.

### Recommended Project Structure

```markdown
## Overview
Brief introduction to what the project does and why you built it.

## Features
- Feature 1: Description

```

## Step 4: Add Project Images

### Image Organization
Create a dedicated folder for each project:

```
public/
  images/
    projects/
      your-project-name/
        main-screenshot.jpg
        feature-demo.gif
        architecture-diagram.png
```

### Adding Images to Content

```markdown
## Screenshots

![Main interface](/images/projects/your-project-name/main-screenshot.jpg)
*Main user interface showing the dashboard*

![Feature demo](/images/projects/your-project-name/feature-demo.gif)
*Animated demonstration of key features*
```

### Image Best Practices
- Use descriptive filenames
- Optimize images for web (WebP format recommended)
- Include alt text for accessibility
- Keep file sizes under 1MB when possible

## Step 5: Complete Project Example

Here's a full example of a project file:

# Task Management Dashboard

A modern, collaborative task management application built with React and Node.js, featuring real-time updates and team collaboration tools.

## Overview

This project was born out of my need for a simple yet powerful task management tool for my development team. While there are many existing solutions, I wanted to create something tailored to our specific workflow and learn full-stack development in the process.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can work on tasks simultaneously with live updates
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive task management with drag-and-drop kanban boards
- **Team Management**: Create teams, assign roles, and manage project access
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and completion statistics
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, using a component-based architecture that promotes reusability and maintainability.

\`\`\`typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'todo' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
  assignedTo: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
\`\`\`

### Real-time Updates
Implemented using Socket.io for bidirectional communication between client and server:

\`\`\`javascript
// Client-side real-time task updates
socket.on('taskUpdated', (updatedTask) => {
  setTasks(prevTasks => 
    prevTasks.map(task => 
      task.id === updatedTask.id ? updatedTask : task
    )
  );
});
\`\`\`

### Database Design
PostgreSQL database with optimized queries for task retrieval and user management:

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  status task_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'todo',
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id),
  assigned_to UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
\`\`\`

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time Synchronization
**Problem**: Ensuring all users see updates immediately without conflicts.
**Solution**: Implemented optimistic updates with conflict resolution and rollback mechanisms.

### Challenge 2: Performance with Large Task Lists
**Problem**: App became slow with hundreds of tasks.
**Solution**: Added virtual scrolling and implemented pagination with infinite scroll.

### Challenge 3: User Authentication
**Problem**: Secure authentication while maintaining good UX.
**Solution**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism and social login options.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT, Passport.js
- **Deployment**: Frontend on Vercel, Backend on Railway
