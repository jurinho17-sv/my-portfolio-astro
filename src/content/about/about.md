# About Me

Hi, I'm Ju Ho Kim.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my page.

I'm a CDSS, Statistics undergrad student at UC Berkeley. I've always admired people in the bay area since I was very young. I still remember cutting out newspaper articles about Bill Gates and Steve Jobs when I was a kid and putting them on the wall. And I was deeply inspired by California's reputation as a global tech hub.

I believe people in Silicon Valley are capable of solving existing problems and preventing future ones as well. My goal is to work in Silicon Valley someday alongside industry leaders. While I know I have so much to learn, I'm still proud of the steps I've taken so far. My optimism drives me to believe that I can achieve my goals no matter how long it takes.

Again, thank you very much for your interest in my journey. I hope you have a fantastic day!

Best regards,  
Ju Ho Kim
