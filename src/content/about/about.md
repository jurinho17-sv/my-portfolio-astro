# About Me

Hi, I'm Ju Ho Kim.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my page.

I'm a junior majoring in Statistics (CDSS) at UC Berkeley. My journey in tech began during my military service in South Korea, which motivated me to come to the United States. I was deeply inspired by California's reputation as a global tech hub.

I believe people in Silicon Valley are capable of solving existing challenges and preventing future problems. My ultimate goal is to work in Silicon Valley alongside industry-leading experts someday. While I know I have so much to learn and improve, I'm proud of the significant steps I've taken so far. My optimism drives me to believe that I can achieve my goals.

Thank you for your interest in my journey. I hope you have a fantastic day!

Best regards,  
Ju Ho Kim
