Hi, I'm Ju Ho Kim.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my website.

I'm a junior at UC Berkeley majoring in Statistics.

In my teens, I was fascinated by people working at tech companies through media, vaguely dreaming of being in Silicon Valley someday. That childhood curiosity faded as I grew older, until my military service in South Korea reignited it. During my service, watching youtube clips like 'My life at FAANG' and vlogs reminded me of those early dreams, and I decided to chase them before it's too late.

In 2023, I came to California and worked my way through community college to UC Berkeley. I don't have a detailed roadmap yet, but I will find it. And, I believe in learning through experience and maintaining an optimistic mindset. My goal is to work in Silicon Valley alongside world-class engineers, growing and contributing at the forefront of technology to make a better world.

I'm excited to continue learning and growing toward this goal.

Thank you for your interest in my journey :)

I hope you have a fantastic day!

Best regards,  
Ju Ho Kim
